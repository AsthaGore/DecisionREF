# DecisionREF
DecisionREF is an AI referee that helps you think through career choices by comparing options and explaining the real trade-offs behind each one.

## Why DecisionREF?

Most career advice systems try to optimize or recommend.  
DecisionREF does something different.

It helps users:
- Understand consequences
- See both sides clearly
- Make decisions with confidence

## Supported Decisions

- Job vs Higher Studies  
- Startup vs MNC  
- India vs Abroad  
- Switch Early vs Stay Longer  

---

## How It Works

1. User selects a decision type  
2. User provides context (priorities, risk tolerance, time horizon)  
3. The AI acts as a **neutral referee**, explaining trade-offs without recommending a single option
