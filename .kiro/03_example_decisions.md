## Example 1: Higher Studies vs Job After Graduation

**User Context**
- Final-year undergraduate
- Average financial background
- Unsure about long-term specialization
- Moderate risk tolerance

**Options Considered**
1. Full-time job immediately
2. Higher studies (Master’s degree)
3. Job + part-time skill development

**Key Trade-offs Identified**
- Job gives financial stability but slows academic depth
- Higher studies increase specialization but delay income
- Hybrid path balances risk but increases workload

**Long-Term Impact**
- Job-first path creates early industry exposure but may narrow future pivots
- Higher studies widen long-term roles but increase short-term pressure
- Hybrid approach preserves flexibility with moderate stress

**Outcome**
DecisionREF does not pick an option.
It explains which path aligns with:
- Financial urgency
- Willingness to delay gratification
- Desire for flexibility
