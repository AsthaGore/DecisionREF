# Kiro’s Contribution to DecisionREF

Kiro played a key role throughout the development of DecisionREF by acting as a co-designer and reasoning assistant.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Idea Refinement
Kiro helped narrow the project from a generic advice system to a focused “decision referee” concept centered on trade-offs rather than recommendations.

### 2. Prompt Engineering
Kiro assisted in:
- Identifying bias in early prompts
- Enforcing neutrality
- Structuring outputs around trade-offs and time horizons

### 3. Scope Control
Kiro helped prevent feature creep by:
- Limiting decisions to four
- Avoiding scoring or ranking mechanisms
- Keeping logic interpretable and simple
