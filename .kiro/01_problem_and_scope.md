# DecisionREF – Problem & Scope

## The Problem

Many students and early professionals struggle when making career decisions.
Choices like:
- Higher studies vs job
- Tech role vs non-tech role
- Startup vs corporate
- One domain vs another

The problem is not lack of information — it is **too much information without clarity**.

People often:
- Compare based on salary alone
- Follow trends without understanding trade-offs
- Regret decisions later because they didn’t think deeply enough

## Why DecisionREF Exists

DecisionREF acts like an **AI referee**, not a decision-maker.

It does not tell users *what* to choose.
Instead, it helps them:
- Compare options side-by-side
- Understand real-world trade-offs
- See long-term impact, not just short-term gain

The goal is **clarity, not persuasion**.

## Scope of the Project

DecisionREF focuses on:
- Career and life-related decisions
- Structured comparison of options
- Honest pros, cons, and risks
- Explainable reasoning instead of generic advice
