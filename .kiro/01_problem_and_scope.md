# DecisionREF — Problem and Scope

## What is DecisionREF?

DecisionREF is an AI-powered **decision referee** built to help early-career individuals think more clearly about important life and career choices.

Instead of telling users what they *should* do, DecisionREF focuses on explaining the **trade-offs** between options. It helps people reflect on decisions based on what actually matters to them — their priorities, risk tolerance, financial situation, and time horizon.

The goal is not to optimize or predict outcomes, but to create **clarity and confidence** in decision-making.

## Why This Problem Matters

Students and early professionals are often required to make decisions that can shape their careers for years. However, most advice available online tends to be:

- Biased toward one “popular” option  
- Disconnected from the user’s personal context  
- Motivational rather than analytical  

As a result, people feel pressured instead of informed.

DecisionREF acts as a neutral referee by:
- Presenting both options honestly and fairly  
- Highlighting real short-term and long-term consequences  
- Adapting the reasoning to the user’s situation  

The aim is not to convince, but to help users **think better**.

## Supported Decisions

DecisionREF currently focuses on four common, high-impact decisions faced by early-career individuals.

### 1. Job vs Higher Studies

This decision influences:

- Depth of knowledge versus practical experience

The trade-offs often involve choosing between immediate income and delayed specialization, along with opportunity cost and personal risk tolerance.

### 2. Startup vs MNC

This choice typically revolves around:
- Risk versus stability

The right balance depends on learning goals, financial runway, and comfort with uncertainty.

### 3. India vs Abroad

This decision affects:

### 4. Switch Early vs Stay Longer

This decision shapes:
- Career narrative and signaling  
- Skill accumulation and depth

The trade-off is often between early exploration and long-term compounding within a role or organization.

Its sole purpose is to explain **reasoned trade-offs**, helping users make informed decisions without taking control away from them.
