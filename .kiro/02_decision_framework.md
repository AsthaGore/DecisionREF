# DecisionREF – Decision Framework

## How DecisionREF Thinks

DecisionREF does not generate random advice.
Every decision is evaluated using a structured framework designed to reduce regret and increase clarity.

The framework focuses on **thinking depth**, not speed.

## Step 1: Understand the User Context

Before comparing options, DecisionREF considers:
- Current education or experience level
- Short-term constraints (money, time, responsibilities)
- Long-term aspirations
- Risk tolerance and learning preference

This prevents generic advice and grounds decisions in reality.

---

## Step 2: Identify the Real Options

Many users think they have only two choices.
DecisionREF expands the view by:
- Identifying hidden alternatives
- Breaking large decisions into smaller paths
- Removing false binaries

Example:
“Higher studies vs job” → hybrid paths, delayed decisions, parallel skill-building.

## Step 3: Evaluate Trade-offs, Not Just Outcomes

Instead of focusing only on results (salary, title),
DecisionREF highlights:
- Opportunity cost
- Skill growth vs comfort
- Short-term pain vs long-term benefit
- Reversibility of the decision

Every option has a cost — DecisionREF makes it visible.

## Step 4: Long-Term Impact Mapping

Decisions are projected across:
- 1 year
- 3 years
- 5 years

This helps users see:
- Lock-in effects
- Growth ceilings
- Exit flexibility

The goal is not prediction, but **awareness**.

## Step 5: Explain, Don’t Decide

DecisionREF never says:
“You should do X.”

Instead, it says:
“If you value A and accept B, then X aligns better.”

The final choice always remains with the user.
