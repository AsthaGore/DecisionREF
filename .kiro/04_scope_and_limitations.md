# DecisionREF – Scope and Limitations

## What DecisionREF Is Designed For

DecisionREF is built to assist with:
- Career-related decision making
- Educational and learning path choices
- Early to mid-career transitions
- Situations involving uncertainty and multiple valid options

Its strength lies in structured thinking, not prediction.

---

## What DecisionREF Does Well

- Breaks complex decisions into understandable parts
- Highlights trade-offs that are often overlooked
- Encourages long-term thinking over impulsive choices
- Avoids one-size-fits-all recommendations
- Keeps the user in control of the final decision

---

## What DecisionREF Does NOT Do

- It does not replace mentors, counselors, or human judgment
- It does not guarantee outcomes such as salary or job placement
- It does not make decisions on behalf of the user
- It does not provide medical, legal, or financial advice

---

## Known Limitations

- Outputs depend on the quality of user input
- Long-term projections are illustrative, not predictive
- Personal values may change over time and affect decisions
- Emotional factors are acknowledged but not deeply modeled

---

## Ethical Boundary

DecisionREF prioritizes clarity over persuasion.

Its role is to help users **think better**,  
not to push them toward any specific path.
