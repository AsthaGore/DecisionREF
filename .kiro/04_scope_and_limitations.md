# Scope and Limitations — DecisionREF

## Project Scope

DecisionREF is intentionally designed as a **decision reasoning assistant**, not a recommendation or prediction system.

Within its scope, DecisionREF:

- Supports four predefined career and life decisions:
  1. Job vs Higher Studies  
  2. Startup vs MNC  
  3. India vs Abroad  
  4. Switch Early vs Stay Longer  

- Accepts user context including:
  - Career stage
  - Primary priority (growth, stability, money, learning)
  - Risk tolerance
  - Financial background
  - Time horizon

- Generates structured explanations that:
  - Compare two options side-by-side
  - Highlight short-term and long-term trade-offs
  - Maintain a neutral, referee-like tone

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

DecisionREF does NOT:

- Recommend a single “best” choice
- Rank options or assign scores
- Predict outcomes or success probabilities
- Replace human judgment or personal reflection
- Use historical data, statistics, or machine learning models

---

## Design Constraints

The following constraints were intentionally applied:

- Logic is kept simple and interpretable
- No personalization beyond user-declared inputs
- No optimization or decision automation
- Focus on clarity over completeness

These constraints ensure the system remains understandable, explainable, and aligned with the “AI Referee” concept.

---

## Known Limitations

- Output quality depends on the clarity of user inputs
- Does not account for rare or highly specialized career paths
- Cannot incorporate real-time market conditions
- Reasoning is qualitative, not quantitative

---

## Rationale for These Limitations

These limitations are deliberate.

By avoiding recommendations, predictions, and scoring, DecisionREF:
- Reduces bias
- Encourages user reflection
- Preserves human agency in decision-making

This aligns directly with the project’s goal:  
**helping users think better, not decide for them.**
